**Abstract:** Property valuation models can achieve mass valuation transparently and cheaply. This paper
develops a number of property valuation models for Kigali, Rwanda, and tests them on a
unique dataset combining remote sensing data and infrastructure and amenities data for
properties in Kigali, with sales transaction data for 2015. We use a machine learning approach,
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, to select from 511 features those that minimise
ten-fold cross validated Mean Absolute Error. Cross validated diagnostics are used to
eliminate overfitting given that our goal is to generate a model that can be used to extrapolate
value estimates out of sample. The performance of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is compared
to that of a range of spatial models. Our best model covering all taxed parcels, achieves a cross
validated R2 of 0.600 and a cross-validated Mean Absolute Error of 0.541. We find that
locational variables relating to connectivity are most consistently important for overall
property value across different models. We also attempt to develop the most accurate method
of calculating building values. Our recommendations for future property valuation in
Rwanda are: i) Given that the goal is extrapolation of the model to estimate the value of all
properties outside of the sample of transacted properties, it is essential to eliminate overfitting
as far as possible. This can be done by optimising cross validated diagnostics such as Mean
Absolute Error and R2. ii) The use of spatial models is desirable, in terms of out-of-sample
accuracy, if and only if extensive testing of various spatial models alongside OLS on the basis
of cross validated diagnostics, is possible; such models often overfit in sample but do not
always outperform OLS out of sample. iii) Ideally a Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal would
help determine full property taxes or land taxes, and not only building taxes, given that it is
more accurate at estimating full property values or land values than it is at finding building
values. Building values are also not directly observable and thus it is impossible to assess the
accuracy of our imputed building value estimates. iv) Additional structural building data on
variables such as building materials and numbers of rooms, which the Government of
Rwanda plans to collect, would improve model accuracy.
